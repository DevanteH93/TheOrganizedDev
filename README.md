# TheOrganizedDev 🛒

TheOrganizedDev is a modern eCommerce web application built with **Next.js**, **Stripe**, and **AWS Amplify**, created as a portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack front-end engineering, interactive cart functionality, secure checkout, and cloud-based hosting.

The application focuses on user experience, state-driven UI updates, responsive design, and a simulated production-style eCommerce workflow.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was built to:
- Demonstrate modern React & Next.js development practices
- Implement a fully interactive shopping cart experience
- Integrate secure payments using Stripe
- Deploy and host the application using AWS Amplify
- Showcase responsive, mobile-first UI design

> **Note:** This project is for demonstration and portfolio purposes only.

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- Add and remove products from a shopping cart
- Live cart value updates based on user interaction
- Cart overlay for quick product review
- Responsive, mobile-first layout across devices
- Secure checkout flow using Stripe
- Hosted and deployed via AWS Amplify
- Client-side and server-side rendering via Next.js

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – React framework with file-based routing, SSR, and optimized performance
- **React.js** – component-based architecture for reusable, state-driven UIs
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic
- **Stripe API** – secure payment processing
- **AWS Amplify** – hosting, deployment, and cloud integration
- **CSS** – responsive styling
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and source management

---

## 🗂️ Application Architecture
The project follows a modular and scalable structure aligned with Next.js best practices:

app/ or pages/
├── components/ # Reusable UI and cart components
├── app/ # Stripe utilities and helpers
├── success/ # Global and component-level styles
└── public/ # Static assets


This promotes maintainability, separation of concerns, and scalability.

## 🛒 Cart & State Management
- Cart state updates in real time as products are added or removed
- Overlay-based cart UI for improved UX
- Derived values (totals, item counts) calculated dynamically
- Component-driven updates without page reloads

---

## 💳 Stripe Checkout Integration
Stripe is used to handle secure checkout and payment processing.  
Key concepts implemented include:
- Stripe Checkout Sessions
- Secure client/server separation
- Environment-based API key management
- Simulated purchase flow for demonstration purposes

> No real products or payments are processed beyond testing.

---


## ☁️ AWS Amplify Hosting
- Application deployed via AWS Amplify
- Continuous deployment from GitHub
- Serverless hosting for scalable front-end distribution
- Environment variables managed securely through Amplify

---

## 🧠 Engineering Concepts Demonstrated
- Component-based UI architecture
- State-driven rendering and derived values
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and routing
- Secure third-party API integration (Stripe)
- Cloud hosting & deployment with AWS Amplify
- Responsive and accessible UI design
- Git-based incremental development workflow
